Originating in Babylon (a province of Persia at the time), Manichaeism once flourished in the ancient world. However, most of the writings of the founding prophet Mani have been lost. Augustine of Hippo, who formerly belonged to the Manichaean faith before converting to Christianity, passionately denounced Manichaeism in his post-conversion writings, and eventually the Manichaean religion was widely persecuted under Christian leaders of the Roman Empire.

The service also usually includes a public examination of the candidate and a sermon or charge concerning the responsibilities of the ministry.

- ***Original Sin***
: in Christian doctrine, the condition or state of sin into which each human being is born; also, the origin (i.e., the cause, or source) of this state.

: also called Pelagian heresy, a 5th-century Christian heresy taught by Pelagius and his followers that stressed the essential goodness of human nature and the freedom of the human will. Pelagius was concerned about the slack moral standards among Christians, and he hoped to improve their conduct by his teachings. Rejecting the arguments of those who claimed that they sinned because of human weakness, he insisted that God made human beings free to choose between good and evil and that sin is a voluntary act committed by a person against God’s law. Celestius, a disciple of Pelagius, denied the church’s doctrine of original sin and the necessity of infant baptism.

- ***pontifex maximus***

- ***Sacrament***
: A religious ceremony that confers God’s grace on the recipient. At the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, the sacraments of Western Christianity were fixed at seven: baptism, confirmation, communion, penance, marriage, extreme unction, and ordination. Because ordained priests (see secular clergy) administer the sacraments and because the sacraments are a route to salvation, the sacramental basis of medieval Christianity was a critical part of the institutional power of its Church.

- ***Traditore***
: ![Traditore](/image/Screen%20Shot%202023-01-26%20at%2023.18.06%20PM.png)

- ***Trial by combat***
: In ordeal by combat, or ritual combat, the victor is said to win not by his own strength but because supernatural powers have intervened on the side of the right, as in the duel in the European Middle Ages in which the “judgment of God” was thought to determine the winner. If still alive after the combat, the loser might be hanged or burned for a criminal offense or have a hand cut off and property confiscated in civil actions.

- ***Trinity***
: The Christian understanding of God as a unity of three persons (triune): Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. According to the doctrine, formulated in the centuries that followed the writing of the New Testament, God has three parts, which are distinguishable in their relations to one another and to humanity. The idea of the Trinity is an attempt to reconcile the diverse statements about God contained in the Bible: the “one God” of the Hebrew Scriptures; the creative and sovereign Father; the “son of God” and “Word made flesh” of the Gospels; the Holy Spirit, present in everyday life and the rituals of worship.

- ***Vulgate***
:  Latin Bible used by the Roman Catholic Church, primarily translated by St. Jerome. In 382 Pope Damasus commissioned Jerome, the leading biblical scholar of his day, to produce an acceptable Latin version of the Bible from the various translations then being used.

# III. Primary Source Analysis.
The following excerpts are from primary sources we have read for class. ALL of them will appear on the exam, you will choose ONE of them.
Answers should be about 300-400 words. 20 points total.

Answers should do the following:
Explain what the text is (e.g. what type of source is it, what is the source about, what do we know about the author, what do we know about where his information comes from, what is the author’s bias, and are there any other issues with the source that need to be taken into account). This information should take no more than a sentence or two; you should focus your efforts on the next two points.
Analyze the quote (briefly explain where the quote is situated in the text and explain what is going on in the quote itself).
Explain how this quote fits in with contemporary themes and/or events discussed in lecture and the textbook (make sure you get your chronology right; if a quote came out of a text produced during the first century, connect it to first-century themes and events, not themes and events from the sixth century).

 1. Tacitus, Germania, 98 AD

On the field of battle it is a disgrace to the chief to be surpassed in valour by his companions, a disgrace to the companions not to equal the valour of their chief. As for leaving a battle alive after your chief has fallen, that means lifelong infamy and shame. To defend and protect him, to attribute one's own acts of heroism to his credit that is what they really mean by “allegiance”. The chiefs fight for victory, the companions for their chief. Many noble youths, if the land of their birth is stagnating in a protracted peace, deliberately seek out other tribes, where some war is afoot. The Germans have no taste for peace; renown is easier won among perils, and you cannot maintain a large retinue except by violence and war.
2.      Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks, late 6th century
Now that Bisinus and Childeric were both kings, Queen Basina, about whom I have told you, deserted her husband and joined Childeric. He questioned her closely as to why she had come from far away to be with him, and she is said to have answered: “I know that you are a strong man and I recognize ability when I see it. I have therefore come to live with you. You can be sure that if I knew anyone else, even far across the sea, who was more capable than you, I would have sought him out and gone to live with him instead.” This pleased Childeric very much and he married her. She became pregnant and bore a son whom she named Clovis. He was a great man and became a famous soldier.
3.      Einhard, Life of Charlemagne, c. 817-830
At the conclusion of this struggle, the Saxon war, that seems to have been only laid aside for the time, was taken up again. No war ever undertaken by the Frankish nation was carried on with such persistence and bitterness, or cost so much labor, because the Saxons, like almost all the tribes of Germany, were a fierce people, given to the worship of devils, and hostile to our religion, and did not consider it dishonorable to transgress and violate all law, human and divine…. The war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King, which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.

**Sample Excerpt**
The Song of Roland, c. 1100
Roland said: “I shall sound the oliphant and Charles, who is going through the pass, will hear it.  I pledge to you, the Franks will soon return.” Oliver said: “That would be most shameful and all your kinsmen would then be blamed; such shame would endure as long as they live.  When I spoke to you of this, you did nothing.  But you will not act so now on my advice.  If you sound the horn, there will be no valour in it.”
Sample Analysis
(What is the text?) The Song of Roland is a chanson de geste that gives a fictionalized account of Charlemagne’s wars in Spain. It circulated orally for many years before being written down by an anonymous author around 1100 AD. As a fictional account, it tells us very little about Charlemagne’s historical activities, but it does give us insight into chivalric culture around the year 1100.
(Where is the quote situated in the text and what is going on in the quote?) Charlemagne’s nephew Roland has been put in charge of the king’s rear-guard as the army leaves Spain. Caught in a narrow pass, Roland and the rest of the rear-guard have been attacked by a much larger Saracen army. Although they are vastly outnumbered by the Saracens, Roland has thus far refused to sound his horn to call back the main body of the Frankish army, in spite of his companion Oliver’s pleas that he do so before the battle began. Now, after it has become clear that they will die, Roland finally sees the wisdom of blowing his horn and offers to call back the Franks. Oliver implies that in refusing to blow his horn before the fighting began, Roland accepted the terms of the battle. Oliver also argues that calling the army back now that the fighting has begun and the rear-guard is being defeated would indeed be a source of shame, not only for Roland, but for his kinsmen as well. While Oliver feels that calling for help before the battle began would have been wise (a virtue that Oliver embodies), he reminds Roland that calling for help when they are being beaten (and after Roland had committed to this course of action) is cowardly.
(How does this quote fit in to the contemporary themes and/or events discussed in lecture and the textbook) The exchange between Roland and Oliver reflects the premium placed on reputation and honor in twelfth-century knightly society, as well as the overwhelming fear of shame in this society. This fear of shame and desire for honor is the most important motivator for knights like Roland and Oliver, and it was the most important way for real knights in the twelfth century to advance in a society organized for war. Honorable and valorous acts were rewarded by lords, while a knight who shamed himself by acting dishonorably could expect no advancement.  It is particularly important to note that just as one’s honor reflects well on one’s family, doing anything shameful will affect not only an individual, but all of their kin as well. Roland’s actions will affect not just himself, but everyone to whom he is related.
